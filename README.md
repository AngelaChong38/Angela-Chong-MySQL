# Angela-Chong-SQL Projects
These 5 projects involve the data for Instagram, furniture store, library books, hospital, and employee data. Each section includes multiple tables. There are schema, data used, SQL query, and also final export result in csv format to be used in any visualization tools such as Tableau. 

Project 1, Instagram data, is one of the final projects in the Udemy certification program. There are 7 tables in this project. The query are used to find who are the newest/oldest members, which day of the week most users are online, who has the most liked Instagram picture, how many times does the average user post, what is the most used hashtags, how many followers per user, which photo has the most comment, and how to rank photos. 

Project 2, Furniture Store data, use query to extract important information that I feel is needed to evaluate any retail store. The exported tables, Proj2_Result_Furniture_Sale_per_State and Proj2_Result_Furniture_Total_Sales, are in csv format and can be used in any visualization tool such as Tableau. 

Project 3, Library Books data, includes 5 tables that allows the queries to list number of books per genre, rank the books, author who wrote most books, best rated author, the average size of the books per each author, books published within a certain time period, and books with words with certain keywords. Again, it is the data I feel a library would want to know. 

Project 4 is Hospital data. It consists of 8 tables. Query includes listing all patient information, list appointment in order by time, list all patientâ€™s medical information, list which doctor who sees the most patient, list which medicine is most prescribed, and which doctor prescribes most medicine. 

The final project, project 5, Employee data, is probably the most used SQL queries out there. In this project, I created 5 tables. Query are used to find average salary per department, who is the newest/oldest employee, average salary in the company by gender, % of male/female employees who makes above average to ensure equality, and ranking employees by salaries within a certain salary bracket. 

The projects use general SQL commands such as JOIN, COUNT, MAX, SUM, GROUP, LIMIT, CASE, ORDER,and TIMEDIFF. It also uses advance SQL code using procedures, ctes, and window functions.
